### Hi there üëã I'm [Aaron Wu](https://github.com/Allenpandas)! You can also call me Allenpandasüêº.

I am a Ph.D. student in the School of Computer and Information Techonoly at [*Beijing Jiaotong University*](https://en.bjtu.edu.cn/), and affiliated with *[THETA Lab](http://jxd308.cn/)*.

Currently, my research has centered on

- **Safety Testing**: testing and evaluation for autonomous driving algorithms, modules, and systems.
- **Data Augmentation**: image or video generation, especially focus on generative data augmentation (GDA) in autonomous driving scenarios.
- **Autonomous Driving Security**: attacks and defenses against the physical world, sensors, algorithms and automonous driving systems.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: safety reinforcement learning (SRL), robustness reinforcement learning and offline reinforcement learning for autonomous driving systems.
